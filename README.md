In this project, we utilized data visualization techniques to extract insights. The dataset comprises information from lotteries for government program apartments, encompassing geographic and demographic data, alongside lottery specifics like price, registrant numbers, and winners. 
We developed graphs and interactive charts that enable users to filter relevant information according to their preferences.

The repository includes three types of files:
1. Excel data file.
2. Python code and PowerBI file for interactive charts.
3. PDF summary report explaining calculation measures, graphs, and conclusions drawn from the data.
